The data from the "Psychophysical measurement of perceived motion flow in naturalistic settings" is contained in this folder.

Dataset S1 (separate file). Raw data of the random-dot kinematogram (RDK) preliminary experiment. The RDK speed and direction were random in each trial. This dataset (RDKDataMatrix.mat) includes a 7 x 1,152  matrix. The 1,152 rows refer to four participants x 288 trials for each participant. The seven columns contain the following information: (1) Participant IDs (1~4); (2) Block IDs (1~2); (3) Trial IDs (1~144); (4) GT angles (0~2 pi); (5) GT speeds (1~10 PPF); (6) Response angles (0~2 pi);  and Response speeds (1~10 PPF). 

Dataset S2 (separate file). Raw response data (display coordinates) of the MPI Sintel Dataset. This main experiment included 2,880 trials in total, thus four participants x 720 trials. All trials proceeded under the same conditions, thus five movies x 36 locations x four flip conditions. The raw response matrices based on the display coordinates (not unflipped) are supplied in MPI_Resp_Raw.zip. The data matrices are 5D matrices of the following dimensions: 2 (uv components or angle/speed) x 36 (probed locations) x 4 (flip conditions) x 5 (movies)  x 4 (participants).

Dataset S3 (separate file). The uv components (stimulus coordinates) of the responses, the GTs, and all models. This folder (MPI_UVcomponents.zip) contains 18 data matrices based on the U (horizontal) and V (vertical) motion vectors of the responses, the GTs, and 16 models. All data are in image coordinates (unflipped from the original coordinates). For the human responses, four participants and four flip conditions were averaged. Each data matrix is a 3D matrix with the following dimensions: 2 (u/v components) x 36 (probed sites) x 5 (movies). For the 1-36 probed locations, no. 2 refers to [1st column, 2nd row] and no. 7 to [2nd column, 1st row] (etc.) of a six-by-six grid. 

Dataset S4 (separate file). Angles and speeds (stimulus coordinates) of the responses, and the GTs, of all models. This folder (MPI_AngSpd.zip) contains 18 data matrices of the angles and speeds of the responses, the ground truths, and 16 models. The data are arranged as in Dataset S3, except that the 3D matrix is 2 (angle/ speed) x 36 (probed sites) x 5 (movies).
